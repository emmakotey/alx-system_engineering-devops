Issue Summary:

Our website went down for two hours on May 10, 2023, from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM Eastern Time. All of our users were hit by the outage, which caused a complete lack of service during this time. Our website's visitors were unable to access it, log in, or carry out any transactions.

Root Cause:

An issue with the database was found to be the main cause of the outage. Specifically, a hardware issue on one of the database servers caused the database to stop responding. This caused a cascading effect on the entire system, leading to the complete outage.

Timeline:

3:00 PM - The issue was first detected by our monitoring system, which sent an alert to the engineering team.

3:05 PM - The engineering team investigated the issue and determined that the database server was unresponsive. They attempted to restart the server, but it did not resolve the issue.

3:15 PM - The team began investigating other possible causes of the issue, such as network issues or application code errors.

3:30 PM - As the investigation continued, it became clear that the issue was related to the database server. The team identified that one of the database servers had experienced a hardware failure.

3:45 PM - The team attempted to migrate the database to a different server to restore service, but encountered issues due to the complexity of the migration process.

4:30 PM - The incident was escalated to senior management and additional resources were brought in to assist with the recovery effort.

5:00 PM - The team was able to successfully migrate the database to a new server and restore service to the website.


Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the issue was a hardware failure on one of our database servers. To prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, we will be implementing a number of corrective and preventative measures, including:

- Adding additional redundancy to our database servers to ensure that a single hardware failure does not cause a complete outage.

- Implementing better monitoring and alerting systems to ensure that we can quickly detect and respond to similar issues in the future.

- Improving our disaster recovery plan to ensure that we can quickly and effectively recover from any future incidents.

Tasks to Address the Issue:

- Upgrade the database server hardware to ensure that it is more resilient to hardware failures.

- Implement database replication to improve redundancy and ensure that data is not lost in the event of a hardware failure.

- Add more detailed monitoring and alerting for our database servers to ensure that we can detect issues before they result in a complete outage.
